## Description

For this project I had to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.The app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using [Handlebars.js](https://handlebarsjs.com/) as the templating language, [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) as the ORM, and the [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) npm package for authentication.

The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
